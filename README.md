# music-project

### Description
The goal of the website is to make a one stop shop for music. We wanted to be able to look up artist and see the artist's profile and discography. Given their different discographies, we want to see the tracks of each album. We added a save button so that we can have a place to see our favorite artist.

### User Story
```

I WANT to look up certain artist,
SO THAT I can see their discography
I WANT to see lyrics of certain songs,
SO THAT I can learn the song
```
